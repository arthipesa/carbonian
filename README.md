# Object Oriented Hypertext Preprocessor (OOPHP)
Object Oriented Programming Concept Implementation 
Using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) Language
<br/>

<h4>Preambule</h4>
<p>
	<b>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</b> (or simply <b>PHP</b>) is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
</p>
<p>	
	<b>PHP</b> originally stood for <i>Personal Home Page</i>, but it now stands for the recursive acronym <b>PHP</b>: <i>Hypertext Preprocessor</i>.
</p>

<p>This project was just a proof of concept to my students or any public audience for this matter, merely anyone who trying to study the difference between Procedural and Object Oriented using native <i>Hypertext Preprocessor Programming Language</i> as known as <b>PHP</b>
